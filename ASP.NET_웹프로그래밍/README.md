## Configuration

Consists of general understanding and basic examples that are frequently used. However, since there is only C# code (.cs) without design elements, if you carefully check the ID value of the widget in the code and place it in Visual Studio, you will get the same result. Because it can be developed through various widgets, it can be a lot of fun in development, but it can be difficult as a first language because of its strong object-oriented concept (OOP).
